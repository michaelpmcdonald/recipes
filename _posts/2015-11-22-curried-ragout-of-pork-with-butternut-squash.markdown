# Curried Ragout of Pork with Butternut Squash

To me, ragouts are the backbone of the late fall and winter kitchen.  Hearty, full of flavor, and easy to prepare, they fill the need for homey, gutsy food that does not let you down.  I grew up with ragouts of all kinds: lamb, veal, sometimes beef, but mostly pork.  The best cut is the shoulder butt, which is tender and extremely flavorful.  Aromatic spices and the all-American butternut squash lift this ragout out of the ordinary and highlight its seasonality.  Since butternut squash is rather bland, be sure to make this dish a day ahead to give the squash plenty of time to absorb the flavors of the ragout.

*	3 pounds boneless pork butt, trimmed and cut into 1.5 inch cubes
*	4 tablespoons unsalted butter
*	1 tablespoon peanut oil
*	salt and freshly ground black pepper
*	2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped
*	2 large cloves of garlic, peeled and finely minced
*	1 tablespoon Madras curry powder
*	2 tablespoons tomato paste
*	1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
*	2 small dry red chili peppers, broken
*	¼ teaspoon ground coriander
*	¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
*	2 cups brown chicken stock
*	1 butternut squash (about 2 pounds), peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
*	2 tablespoons dark-brown sugar
*	1 tablespoon arrowroot mixed with 2 tablespoons stock
*	garnish: 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh cilantro

1.	Preheat oven to 350 F.
2.	Dry the pork cubes thoroughly with paper towels. In a heavy 12-inch cast-iron skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the oil over medium-high heat.  Add the pork cubes a few at a time and saute until nicely browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch.  Do not crowd the pan. Transfer each batch of pork as it is browned to a heavy 4-quart casserole, season with salt and pepper, and set aside.
3.	Discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the pan.  Add the onions and garlic and cook for 2 or 3 minutes or until soft but not browned.  Add the curry powder, tomato paste, cloves, chili peppers, ground coriander, and cinnamon and cook for 1 minute longer.  Add the brown chicken stock and stir until well blended.
4.	Transfer the onion-stock mixture to the casserole.  Bring to a boil, cover the casserole tightly, and place in the center of the preheated over.  Braise for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the meat is tender when pierced with a fork.
5.	While the pork is braising, steam the butternut squash in a vegetable steamer for 3 or 4 minutes. It should still be quite crisp.  Remove and reserve.  Melt the remaining butter in a 10-inch skillet, add the brown sugar and the butternut squash, and saute for 2 or 3 minutes, or until the squash is almost tender and nicely caramelized.  Reserve.
6.	Fifteen minutes before the pork is done, add the caramelized squash cubes to the ragout, replace the cover, and continue cooking.
7.	When the meat is done, remove it carefully with the squash to a side dish.  Carefully degrease the pan juices.  Return the pan juices to the casserole, bring to a boil, and whisk in just enough of the arrowroot mixture until the sauce lightly coats a spoon.  Return the meat and squash to the casserole and just heat through.  Taste and correct the seasoning.  Transfer the ragout to a serving dish, sprinkle with the fresh cilantro, and serve hot.

Note: You may add cubed carrots, turnips, or small pearl onions to the butternut squash.  Other winter squashes such as acorn or spaghetti squash cannot be used as a substitute, but would make good side dishes for the ragout.
