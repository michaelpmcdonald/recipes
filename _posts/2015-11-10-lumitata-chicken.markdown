Go see the [luminata parade](http://fremontartscouncil.org/facevents/luminata/) and welcome in autumn.  But first, make this:

Ingredients:

* 1-1.5 lb chicken breasts
* 1 large or 2 small (12oz) jars artichoke hearts
* 1 jar sun-dried tomatoes
* 1 cup white wine
* 2 tbsp olive oil (from sun-dried tomatoes if possible)
* 2 medium garlic cloves
* 1 pint cream
* 1 cup parmesan
* 1 cup romano
* 1 cup green onions
* 2 cups mushrooms
* 1 lb bowtie pasta
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1/8 tsp dried ghost pepper (or equivalent cayenne)

Cut chicken into medallions and brown lightly in a skillet.  Add water and allow to cook until about 75% doneness - it will finish in the sauce later.

Add wine to a medium saucepan and start reducing to a volume of about 1/4 cup.

Set chicken aside and dry the skillet.  Add olive oil and heat to saut√© temperature.  Add mushrooms and brown lightly.  Lower temperature, then add garlic, cooking lightly but not allowing to brown.  Then add sun-dried tomatoes and stir continually for thirty second.  Set ingredients aside.

Begin preparing water for pasta.

When the wine has been reduced, add the contents of the skillet to the sauce pan, along with one pint cream, ghost pepper, chicken, and salt.  Bring the sauce to a light simmer and allow to cook for 5 minutes.  Add green onions and drained artichokes and remove from heat.  Sauce should stay warm on its own while the pasta cooks.

Add pasta to water and cook until al dente.

When pasta has completed cooking, drain.  Add cheese to sauce and stir in gently, then serve on top of pasta.
