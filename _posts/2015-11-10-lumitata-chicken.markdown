Go see the [luminata parade](http://fremontartscouncil.org/facevents/luminata/) and welcome in autumn.  But first, make this:

# Ingredients:

* 1-1.5 lb chicken breasts
* 1 large or 2 small (12oz) jars artichoke hearts
* 1 jar sun-dried tomatoes
* 1 cup white wine (or chicken stock + lemon juice)
* 2 tbsp olive oil (from sun-dried tomatoes if possible)
* 2 medium garlic cloves
* 1 pint cream
* 1 cup parmesan
* 1 cup romano
* 1 cup green onions
* 2 cups mushrooms
* 1 lb bowtie pasta
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1/8 tsp dried ghost pepper (or equivalent cayenne)

# Preparation:

Cut chicken into medallions and brown lightly in a skillet.  Add water and allow to cook until about 75% doneness - it will finish in the sauce later.

Add wine to a medium saucepan and start reducing to a volume of about 1/4 cup.  If using ghost pepper flakes, add them to the reduction to allow them to reconstitute and shed flavor.  If using cayenne, add to sauce with cream etc.

Set chicken aside and dry the skillet.  Add olive oil and heat to saut√© temperature.  Add mushrooms and brown lightly.  Lower temperature, then add garlic, cooking lightly but not allowing to brown.  Then add sun-dried tomatoes and stir continually for 30 seconds.  Once wine/stock is reduced, transfer ingredients to sauce pan.

Begin preparing water for pasta.

Add one pint cream, chicken, and salt to sauce pan.  Bring the sauce to a light simmer and allow to cook for 5 minutes.  Add green onions and drained artichokes and remove from heat.  Sauce should stay warm on its own while the pasta cooks.

Add pasta to water and cook until al dente.

When pasta has completed cooking, drain.  Add cheese to sauce and stir in gently, then serve on top of pasta.

Yields 6-8 servings.
